# Investigating the Drivers of Global Warming




## Overview

This project aims to comprehensively examine the factors contributing to global warming by analyzing a diverse dataset of global surface temperature measurements, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, volcanic activity, and solar irradiance over various timescales. By employing robust statistical methods and data visualization techniques, we will explore the relationships between these variables to discern whether human-made factors, particularly increased CO2 emissions, are the primary drivers of observed global temperature increases
